# DE-RAILS

De-Rails is a railway reservation website made using php, html, css, javascript and a MySql database and it serves as a proof of concept of the same.
It is assumed that the data about the users, trains and the tickets are kept in a local MySql database.

It allows a user to check availability of seats in trains, book train tickets, view and cancel his booked tickets.

It also allows the admin to add a new user, remove an existing user, update the train list and other administrative functions.
